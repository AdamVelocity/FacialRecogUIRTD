DOES NOT CURRUNTLY WORK AS FIREBASE PROJECT WAS DELETED

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based attendance system that can automatically
recognize and record attendance for a group of people using facial recognition technology called
FaceTrack. FaceTrack is developed using the OpenCV-Python library, which provides a set of
tools for image and video processing tasks, and the Facial Recognition Python Library, which
provides a powerful machine learning algorithm for facial recognition tasks.
FaceTrack is designed to capture images from a camera, detect and crop faces, and compare the
faces with the trained model to recognize each person in the group. The attendance and data of
each person is recorded in a database, which can be accessed and analysed by authorized
personnel.
The project also includes a user interface, which is developed using Inkscape and PyCharm. The
user interface provides an easy-to-use platform for interacting with the attendance system,
allowing authorized personnel to view attendance records, generate reports, and manage
FaceTrack settings. FaceTrack is deployed on Firebase, which provides a secure and reliable
platform storing the attendance data.
The project has several advantages over traditional attendance and entry systems, such as paperbased systems or RFID systems. It eliminates the need for physical interaction, which saves time
and reduces errors. It also provides a more accurate and reliable attendance record, as it is based
on facial recognition technology, which is more difficult to forge or manipulate than other
methods. Additionally, FaceTrack is easy to use and customizable, providing a flexible and
scalable solution.
